# File-Processing

This repository contains scripts I developed during the Open EDG File Processing Course.

In this course, I learned how to:

* Interact with SQLite databases using the sqlite3 module.
* Create and process XML files using the xml module.
* Read, write, and process CSV files using the csv module.
* Create and process log messages from Python programs using the logging module.
* Manage configuration files using the configparser module.

After completing this course, I am able to work with different kinds of data files from various sources and use them in projects requiring data manipulation and file processing. The course helped me gain the skills and knowledge required for data analysis, software development, and troubleshooting.
